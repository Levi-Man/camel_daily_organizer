## Rough breakdown of tasks

1. Set up GitHub
	- create a repo and project board
	- make sure branches are set up and used by everyone
	- add users and adjust permissions
	- make sure reviews are required when committing 
	- create our project folder to house code

2. Project Breakdown
	- make sure features fulfill the project's mission 
	- make sure the project fits class requirements 
	- plan out tasks and figure out what each of our strengths are
	- Sort out what features we would like to implement and what technologies they require
	- research APIs and see what can work for each feature

4. Set up a Project board on GitHub with the tasks and assign them accordingly
	- prioritize what should be tackled first
	- each task/issue is listed and in the correct place 
	- assign tasks accordingly
	- maintain it
	- have daily SCRUM meetings

5. Create a skeleton
	- create a basic HTML page with a very simple layout
	- have sections where our widgets will be placed so we can use those to test the information the APIs can pull

7. Map out functionality
	- plan out what information we can pull from the API' and see how customizable they are
	- figure out where buttons can go and what they should be doing
	- map out more complex components like the kanban board/to-do list

8. Adding to the Project Board
	- once each widget or feature is mapped out it will be assigned to a member
	- member will carry out the task and once ready submit the branch for review
	- review will be done by the other two members
		- review should entail checking for bugs, clean code, comments, correct format, etc
	- once approved the task can be labeled as finished and added to the main branch

9. Development
	- once tasks have been delegated to members and branches have been made, members can start to work on the code of each task
	- make sure not to commit to the main branch
	- if that does happen save and pause all other tasks and work together as a team to revert the changes and make sure nothing is missing

10. Deployment
	- test to see if responsive
	- test for bugs
	- test for functionality between widgets, API's, and saving
	- make sure UI is polished and works as intended
	- finish the readMe
	- deploy project on GitHub

11. Presentation
	- pitch out the project
  - explain technologies used
  - show a demo
  - present future ideas
